As cringey as this title may feel for some I felt it was actually quite fitting. When first learning a programming language people often start by writing a very simple program that prints out Hello World. 

```
print("Hello World")
```

Even though these programs don't hold a very high educational value they get the learner's feet wet. And similarly I want to get my feet wet writing this post.

My motivation starting this site is simply put: **I want to become a famous blogger to make money and earn my first million euros before I turn 30** *(Just kidding)*. 


The real reason is that I want to get better at writing and share whatever goes on in my life. Could be a recipe I found, a technical tutorial, a letter of complaint, basically anything and everything that interests me.

## [~]$ WhoAmI

My name is Raoul, 20 something years old, a german living in Germany. Maybe it has already become very clear what my profession is, from the various hints I have dropped: I work as a software engineer, to be specific I develop iOS mobile applications. But that's luckily not my entire personality.


I do a lot of sports especially bouldering and running, cook and eat passionately (the main reason why I do so much sport), read a lot, spend as much time as I can outside and try to learn new stuff every week. 


About all of these topics I want to share something on this site. Tbth it's most probably going to be technical topics but from time to time if I see any kind of value in writing about different topics, I will.
